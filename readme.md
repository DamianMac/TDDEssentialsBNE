# TDD Essentials

This is the starting point for the TDD Essentials workshop.

You'll need to have the Dotnet Core 2.2 SDK installed, you can find that [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).


I'll be using VSCode, so if you have that installed we can build and run tests from within the editor. You're welcome to use anything else though.

As preparation for the course, install .NET Core, clone the repo, and from the root directory run:

```
dotnet restore

dotnet build
```

If everything runs you're all ready to go.
